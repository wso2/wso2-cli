# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the WSO2 CLI.

## Scope

Contributions may improve the CLI implementation, public SDK, product
requirements, architecture decisions, examples, command conventions, tests, or
supporting public-source research.

## Building and testing

The repository contains three independently buildable Go modules: the shell at
the repository root, the public SDK in `sdk/`, and the example module in
`modules/example/`. `go.work` composes them from source for local development.
The SDK version required by the example module is published, so the workspace
currently has no `replace` directive. During an SDK release, one temporary
workspace replacement may be needed while the example module requires a
version that has not been published yet. See
[release artifacts](docs/reference/release-artifacts.md) for that procedure.
Committed `replace` directives are prohibited in every
`go.mod`; a test and the previous-protocol gate below both enforce this.

One command builds all three modules and runs every test layer, and it is the
same command continuous integration runs:

```shell
./scripts/acceptance.sh
```

That is the architecture-proof acceptance gate. It roots every run in a
temporary state directory and clears any ambient `WSO2_` variable first, so it
never reads or writes real WSO2 state, and it needs no network catalog, no
credentials, and no product service.

A second gate proves the older half of the protocol window:

```shell
./scripts/previous-protocol.sh
```

It resolves the newest published SDK whose protocol generation is the
predecessor of this branch's, builds the example module against that SDK
with the workspace dropped, and launches it under the shell built from this
checkout. That is the dependency graph a released module has, and it is the
one graph nothing else here reproduces. It needs a reachable module proxy;
the acceptance gate does not.

CI runs `govulncheck` for the shell, SDK, and every product module on pull
requests and weekly. To reproduce a finding locally, install
`govulncheck` and run:

```shell
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.4 go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.8.0
```

Then run:

```shell
(govulncheck ./...)
(cd sdk && GOWORK=off govulncheck ./...)
for mod in modules/*/go.mod; do
  (cd "$(dirname "$mod")" && govulncheck ./...)
done
```

Fix actionable findings by updating the affected dependency or code. If a
finding cannot be reached or addressed, record the evidence and rationale in
the pull request.

While working on one module, run that module alone:

```shell
go build ./...                      # shell
go test ./...                       # shell, including acceptance tests
(cd sdk && GOWORK=off go test ./...)  # SDK without workspace composition
(cd modules/example && go test ./...)  # example module
```

The shell, protocol, SDK, and module versions move independently and are
injected at build time. The protocol window is not: a release build leaves it
alone, because the shell supports the current protocol version and its
predecessor, declared once in `sdk/protocol`. Only tests narrow it, by
injecting `internal/version.protocolVersion`.

```shell
go build -ldflags "\
  -X github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/internal/version.shellVersion=0.1.0" ./cmd/wso2

cd modules/example && go build -ldflags "\
  -X main.moduleVersion=0.1.0 \
  -X github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/sdk/module.SDKVersion=0.1.0" ./cmd/wso2-module-example
```

A release build also injects `internal/catalog.releasedIndex`: the published
`index.json`, base64-encoded, which `wso2 help` lists products from. The release
workflow fetches it; a build without it lists only installed products. To see
the help page a release would print:

```shell
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/internal/catalog.releasedIndex=$(
  curl -fsSL https://wso2.github.io/wso2-cli/index.json | base64 | tr -d '\n')" ./cmd/wso2
```

Every Go file begins with the Apache-2.0 license header, followed by a blank
line so the header does not become package documentation. A test in
`internal/boundaries` enforces both.

### The module contract schema

The shell and every module exchange Protobuf messages defined in
`sdk/proto/wso2/cli/module/v1/contract.proto`. The generated Go types in
`sdk/protocol/contractv1` are committed, so building and testing the repository
needs neither a Protobuf toolchain nor network access.

After editing any `.proto` file, regenerate and commit the result:

```shell
./scripts/generate-protobuf.sh
```

The script fetches a pinned `buf` and a remote code-generation plugin, so it
needs network access while it runs. It also applies the license header, which
code generators do not emit.

Tests never read or write real WSO2 user state. The shell resolves all local
state below one root, overridden with `WSO2_HOME`, and the test-only fixture
installer refuses to write into `~/.wso2`.

## Starting a new product module

```sh
make new-module NAMESPACE=mycloud
```

This creates `modules/mycloud`, which builds and passes its own test with
nothing edited, and composes it in the workspace. The SDK version it depends on
and the protocol versions it declares are read from the checkout rather than
written into a template, so a generated module is never generated against a
version this repository does not build against.

The namespace is the first word of every command the module will answer, so it
is refused when another module already declares it, when a shell command owns it
— such a module could never be reached, because the shell resolves its own
commands first — when it is the example module's reserved namespace, or when
it is not something a user could type. Nothing is written when a namespace is
refused.

`docs/guides/build-module-quickstart.md` carries the rest: what to change
first, how a handler asks the shell for access, and how the module is released.

## Documentation standards

Contributions must:

- use formal, concise, and inclusive language;
- distinguish accepted decisions from proposals and open questions;
- preserve the authority hierarchy described in
  [docs/README.md](docs/README.md);
- cite public primary sources for externally verifiable technical claims;
- avoid secrets, customer information, personal data, private repository
  references, internal infrastructure details, and non-public business
  information;
- use reserved example domains such as `example.com` and `example.invalid`;
- keep commands and configuration samples non-destructive and free of
  credential values; and
- update affected links and indexes when documents are added, moved, or
  renamed.

## Proposing changes

1. Open an issue or discussion for a material requirement or architecture
   change.
2. Update the authoritative document and any affected reference or example
   files.
3. Add or revise an architecture decision record when the change establishes a
   durable project-wide constraint.
4. Verify Markdown formatting, relative links, examples, and terminology.
5. Submit a focused pull request that explains the decision and its impact.

Research documents may compare alternatives, but final requirements belong in
`docs/product-requirements.md` and final architecture decisions belong in
`docs/architecture.md` or an accepted decision record.

## Security-sensitive contributions

Do not open a public issue or pull request containing a suspected credential,
private infrastructure detail, or unpublished vulnerability. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.
