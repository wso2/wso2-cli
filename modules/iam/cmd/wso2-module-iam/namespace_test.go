// TestEveryCommandThisModuleNamesIsItsOwn catches the mistake that shipped
// once: a repository-wide rename of the word "identity" rewrote this module's
// own namespace out of its next-step and recovery text, so wso2 iam user
// list told the reader to run wso2 account resource-server list — a command
// no shell has.
//
// It is worth a test rather than care because the damage is invisible to every
// other check: the module compiles, its handlers return the right fields, and
// the shell renders them faithfully. Only a person following the instruction
// finds out.
//
// The check itself lives in sdk/testkit, shared by every product module,
// because the commands it protects come from this module's own declared
// tree — commands().Declare(), the same declaration the shell parses a command
// line against — rather than from a list kept here by hand. A hand list is
// exactly what let the fault ship in the first place: nothing forced it to be
// updated when a command was, so it drifted from what the module actually
// serves.
