// internal/statusservice, and the duplication is the boundary being real: the
// module and the service agree by contract, not by sharing code.

// defaultStatusTimeout bounds one call to the status service when the
// invocation names no other. It is well inside the shell's invocation deadline,
// so a slow service produces this module's typed problem rather than the shell
// terminating the process. "wso2 reference call --timeout" overrides it, which
// is what gives this module a declared flag to exercise (#153).
