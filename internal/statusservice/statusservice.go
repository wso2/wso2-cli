// Package statusservice is the architecture proof's local read-only status
// service.
//
// It stands in for a product service so the brokered-access boundary has
// something real to be proved against. It establishes trust one of two
// ways: against a source credential it shares with the shell, which is
// also how it reads an invocation binding out of the presented token; or
// by verifying an access token's signature against the keys an OpenID
// issuer publishes, which is what a production service does instead. Only
// the first way binds an invocation, because no OAuth issuer mints such a
// claim — the header naming one is still required of every caller, but
// nothing holds an issuer-minted token to it. Whichever way trust is
// established, a request is accepted only when the token presented is one
// this service was configured to serve, for its audience, scope, and
// organization, and is still within its life. Anything else is refused
// without the service doing any work.
//
// It is test infrastructure. It is an internal package with no shell command
// behind it, it is never linked into the shell binary, and it establishes no
// product API. A real product service replaces it and enforces the same claims
// through its own identity provider.

// StatusPath is the only path the service serves.
//
// The example module repeats this path, the bearer scheme, and
// InvocationHeader rather than importing them: a product module cannot depend
// on a shell package, so a service's call shape is knowledge a module carries
// on its own. The duplication is the boundary being real.
const StatusPath = "/status"

// WhoamiPath serves the claims this service verified on the presented access.
//
// It exists so the access the shell brokers can be seen end to end: the shell
// mints a token, the module presents it without ever reading it, and the
// audience reports back what it verified. A module must not introspect the
// access it carries, so the only party that can answer this honestly is the
// service the token was minted for. Nothing derived from the source credential
// is in the answer — the claims are reported, the token never is.
const WhoamiPath = "/whoami"

// InvocationHeader names the shell invocation a request belongs to.
//
// The service compares it with the token's own invocation claim, so a caller
// cannot present access granted for one invocation as part of another. Both
// values come from the caller, so this is a binding check rather than replay
// detection: it proves the token belongs to the invocation the caller is
// acting as, not that the caller is that invocation. Proving the latter needs
// an identity provider the audience trusts, which is exactly what the

	// other.
	SourceCredential string
	// Issuer is the OpenID issuer whose signature this service accepts. A
	// service is configured with either this or a source credential, never
	// both: they are two ways to answer the same question, and a service that
	// would take either answer accepts a token that satisfies the weaker one.
	//
	// It is also the organization binding for a deployment that mints no
