// Package oauthflow runs one interactive login, in either of the two modes an
// OIDC identity can be established by.
//
// Login is the browser Authorization Code + PKCE mode, the default for a person
// sitting at the machine. DeviceLogin is the RFC 8628 Device Authorization
// Grant mode, for a machine whose user has no browser it can reach — a remote
// shell, a container — where the approval happens on another device entirely.
// Both produce the same Result, so a session established either way is
// indistinguishable everywhere downstream.
//
// The standard libraries own the protocol: go-oidc discovers the issuer and
// verifies the identity token, and x/oauth2 builds the authorization URL,
// exchanges the code, and runs the device polling loop. This package owns only
// what they cannot — binding a callback port the OAuth application is actually
// registered for, printing what the user must act on before anything else can
// fail, proving the callback that arrives belongs to the login this process
// started, and turning every failure into a typed problem that never repeats
// the deployment's own words.
//
// No value the flows produce is ever written to their output stream: the
// terminal sees a URL, a user code, and progress — never token material, and
// never the device code.
