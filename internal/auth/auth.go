// Package auth is the shell's authentication broker.

// Authentication is shell policy. A module never holds a credential, never
// learns where one comes from, and never decides what access it has: it asks
// for an audience and scopes, and the shell answers from facts the module
// cannot influence — the module receipt it was installed with, the selected
// context, and the invocation in progress.
//
// The broker is created per invocation and is used from the one goroutine
