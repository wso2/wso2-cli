// Package devorigin installs a module that has not been published yet, by
// standing the real catalog up in front of the real installer.
//
// A module author could not run their own module until it was tagged: the SDK's
// test kit drives a module through the contract in process, but it is a
// conforming peer rather than the shell, so a module that satisfies it is not
// thereby proven installable or launchable. This closes that gap without
// inventing a second install path. The module is built, packed into the archive
// a release would publish, described by a catalog the real generator produced,
// served over a short-lived loopback origin, and then installed by
// install.Installer with nothing about the installation made easier. What the
// developer ends up with passes the same receipt validation, records the same
// version policy, and is rolled back the same way as a published module, so the
// problems worth meeting early are met here rather than by their users.
// docs/adr/0011-local-module-install-through-a-development-origin.md records
// why the shortcut of writing the store entry directly was rejected.
//
// This is contributor tooling. Nothing a user installs contains it, and no
// shell command reaches it.
