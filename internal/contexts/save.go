// its read-modify-write.
//
// The critical section is a file read, an in-memory change, and a file write,
// with no network call inside it by design (ADR 0011, #112 D8), so this is
// short — two orders of magnitude below the session lock's deadline, which has
// to outlast a token refresh round trip. A holder that has not finished in this
// long is stuck rather than slow, and waiting longer only delays the refusal.

//
// It sits beside the document rather than under cli/locks, which is the session
// store's per-credential-reference namespace. A reference is a bare word, so a
// document lock placed there under any fixed name could collide with a real
// identity's lock — an identity whose credentialRef happened to be that word
// would share a lock with the document itself, and a login would serialize
// against an unrelated write. Keying the lock by the document's own path cannot

// it cannot refuse a merely corrupt document that a writer ought to be able to
// repair, which a Load-shaped guard would. Both reads happen under the lock, so
// they cannot disagree.
//
