// than an accident: a caller that cannot ask the question behaves as if a
// human is not watching, which is the safer of the two answers.

// StdinIsTerminal reports whether the process's standard input is attached to
// a terminal.
//
// This is the one stream Streams does not carry (see login_create.go's
// resolveClientID and #86), so a caller that needs to know whether a person
// could answer a prompt asks the process directly rather than through a
// Shell field.

// ColorEnabled reports whether w should receive ANSI color escapes.
//
// NO_COLOR (https://no-color.org) disables color when the variable is
// "present and not an empty string", so NO_COLOR= (present, empty) does NOT
// disable color and NO_COLOR=1 does. This follows the cited spec exactly
// rather than a stricter presence-only test: NO_COLOR is a cross-tool
// convention, not this repository's own, and a user who sets it expects the
// documented behaviour rather than a variant this shell invented.
//
// This is deliberately inconsistent with WSO2_NO_INPUT, which IS an
// emptiness test (WSO2_NO_INPUT= and WSO2_NO_INPUT=0 both mean "no input").
// That difference is not an oversight: WSO2_NO_INPUT is this repository's
// own variable and this repository's own rule to set, while NO_COLOR is
// not ours to redefine.
//
// With NO_COLOR absent or empty, the answer falls back to whether w is a
// terminal: a piped or redirected stream gets no escape codes even without
// the variable set, because there is nothing there to render them.
//
// FORCE_COLOR turns color on for a stream that is not a terminal but renders
// ANSI anyway — a Jupyter cell or a CI log — when set to anything but empty
// or "0". NO_COLOR still wins over it: the person who opted out is not
// overruled by a tool that opted in.
//
// There is no configuration layer here (a "color" preference was in the
// original wave 4 design and was cut before shipping — see
// internal/preferences's package doc comment). Hint is the one consumer, and
// a "color" preference would earn its place back into the closed key set when
// the environment variables stop being enough.
