# This script is meant to be read before it is run, so it stays flat and boring:
# one function per step, no indirection, and nothing that needs elevated
# privileges. It downloads an archive from a published release, verifies it
# against the checksum file published beside it, and refuses to install anything
# that fails that check.
#
# The artifact names, the checksum file, and the tag resolution it depends on are
# documented in docs/reference/release-artifacts.md.
#
# Variables it reads:
#
#	WSO2_HOME                  State root to install into. Default ~/.wso2.
#	WSO2_CLI_PRERELEASE=true   Resolve the newest prerelease, not the newest
#	                           stable release.
#	WSO2_CLI_NO_PROFILE=1      Install without editing any shell profile or
#	                           setting up tab completion.
#	WSO2_CLI_RELEASE_BASE_URL  Where releases are downloaded from. Overridden by
#	WSO2_CLI_RELEASE_API_URL   the tests; users have no reason to set either.
