# Removes what scripts/install.sh added on macOS, Linux, and WSL.
#
#	bash uninstall.sh              # remove the binary and the profile block
#	bash uninstall.sh --purge      # also remove configuration and contexts
#
# It removes the binary, the directory the installer created for it, the
# delimited block the installer appended to a shell profile (tab completion
# included), and the fish completion file. It does not remove configuration or
# contexts unless asked: removing a binary is not the same decision as abandoning
# a setup, and silently destroying the second would be the worse default.
#
# Running it when nothing is installed is not a failure. It reports what it found
# and exits successfully, which is also what makes it usable to clean up after an
# install that failed halfway.
#
# The block markers and paths here must match scripts/install.sh exactly. They are
# repeated rather than shared because each script is fetched and run on its own,
# so neither can source the other.
