# Runs the architecture-proof acceptance gate.
#
# This is the whole of what "the proof passes" means, in one command that a
# contributor and CI both run. It builds the three independently versioned
# modules from the checkout it is run in and then runs every test layer the
# proof depends on, ending with the black-box runs that drive the built shell
# and the built module through the same external seam a user does.
#
# Each layer proves one thing: the modules build against the released SDK,
# unit and integration tests pass, then the black-box runs drive the built
# shell and the built module through the same external seam a user does.
#
# It needs a Go toolchain and a warm or reachable module cache. It needs no
# Protobuf toolchain, no network catalog, no WSO2 credentials, and no real
# product service: everything the proof authenticates against is a fixture this
# repository builds.

# No acceptance run may read or write the developer's real WSO2 state. Every
# test roots the shell in its own temporary directory, and this is the second
# lock on that: an ambient WSO2_HOME cannot reach the runs, and a run that
# somehow ignored its own root would land here rather than in ~/.wso2.
#
# Every other WSO2_ variable is cleared for the same reason. The credential the
# proof uses is supplied by the harness under a name it owns, so an ambient one
# can only make a run pass for a reason the gate did not intend.

# Every go test run below names its timeout rather than inheriting go test's

# close to that on an idle machine and past it on a loaded one, and a run that
# hits the default dies as a panic naming whichever test was in flight, which
# reads as a hung test rather than as a suite that needed longer. See #147 and
# #235. The value is the Makefile's TEST_TIMEOUT, which `make acceptance` passes
# through; the fallback here must match it for a direct run.

# added anywhere in the shell module is tested by the gate whether or not
# anyone remembered to list it here. The packages of stage 4 are unchanged
# since they ran, so the test cache answers for them and only the black-box
# runs cost anything.
