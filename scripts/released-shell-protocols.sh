# Prints the module-contract protocol versions the currently released shell
# speaks, by asking the published binary rather than by reading this checkout.
#
# The gate compares a module against the shell a user can actually have, and
# between a protocol bump landing on the default branch and the shell release
# that carries it, the two are not the same thing. The published binary's answer
# comes from sdk/protocol all the same: the shell's release workflow refuses to
# publish a binary whose window is not the one the source declares.
#
# Nothing is printed when no shell has been released yet, which the caller reads
# as "fall back to what this checkout declares". Every other failure is fatal:
# reading an outage as "no shell is released" would open the gate.
