# Proves that a product module built against the previous protocol still runs
# under the shell built from this branch.
#
# The older half of the protocol window is a promise to users who have not
# updated the shell yet, and nothing in this repository breaks visibly when it
# is broken: the reference module in this checkout is always built against the
# SDK at head, so it always speaks the current protocol. This gate is the one
# run that reproduces a released module's dependency graph instead — the
# workspace dropped, the SDK resolved by version from the module proxy — and
# launches the result as a real subprocess under a real shell.
#
# Dropping the workspace is also what enforces the prohibition on committed
# replace directives: a module whose go.mod replaces the SDK never resolves a
# published one, so the rule is checked here rather than merely written down.
#
# This is a pull-request gate, and it is distinct from the release gate: this
# one catches "we broke the older protocol", while the release gate catches
# "this module cannot run on any shell that exists".
#
# It needs a Go toolchain and a reachable module proxy. It reports its own
# conclusion in full on the last line, so a reader of a CI log never has to
# infer what was proved.
