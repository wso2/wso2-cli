.SYNOPSIS
Installs the wso2 shell on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
Downloads the published archive for this machine, verifies it against the
checksum file published beside it, and installs the binary under the WSO2 state
root with its directory added to the per-user PATH and tab completion set up in
the PowerShell profile.

Nothing here needs administrator rights: no symbolic link is created, no machine
level environment variable is written, and no installer is registered. A run that
cannot verify what it downloaded installs nothing.

The artifact names, the checksum file, and the tag resolution this depends on are
documented in docs/reference/release-artifacts.md.

.PARAMETER Version
The release tag to install, such as v0.1.0. Defaults to the newest stable
release.

.EXAMPLE
iwr <install url> -useb | iex

.EXAMPLE
&([scriptblock]::Create((iwr <install url> -useb))) v0.1.0

.NOTES
Environment variables it reads:

  WSO2_HOME                    State root to install into. Default ~\.wso2.
  WSO2_CLI_PRERELEASE=true     Resolve the newest prerelease, not the newest
                               stable release.
  WSO2_CLI_NO_PROFILE=1        Install without changing any environment
                               variable or setting up tab completion.
  WSO2_CLI_RELEASE_BASE_URL    Where releases are downloaded from.
  WSO2_CLI_RELEASE_API_URL
  WSO2_CLI_POWERSHELL_PROFILE  The PowerShell profile tab completion is set up
                               in, in place of $PROFILE.

  The last three are overridden by the tests; users have no reason to set them.
