# Release artifacts

**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-28

This document is the naming contract between a published release and the
programs that download from it. An install script derives every URL it needs
from a resolved tag and this convention alone: no manifest, no index, and no API
call beyond resolving the tag. Changing anything here breaks installers that are
already in users' hands, so it changes only with a deliberate migration.

The configuration that implements this is `.goreleaser.yaml`, and the workflow
that publishes it is `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Where artifacts are published

GitHub Releases on `wso2/wso2-cli`. A pushed tag matching `v*` publishes one
release named for that tag.

This is the interim distribution channel. Signed, per-platform channels remain
the destination, and the archives described here are the inputs those
channels package.

## Archive names

```text
wso2-cli-<tag>-<os>-<arch>.<extension>
```

| Component     | Values                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `<tag>`       | The Git tag verbatim, including its leading `v`  |
| `<os>`        | `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`                     |
| `<arch>`      | `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm`, `386`                   |
| `<extension>` | `tar.gz` for Linux, `zip` for macOS and Windows  |

The tag appears verbatim so that a script which resolved a tag can build the
name without transforming it.

The operating system and architecture tokens are not what platform detection
reports, and both have to be normalized before a name is built.

On macOS and Linux, `uname -s` answers `Linux` and `Darwin`, which lower-case to
the tokens above, and `uname -m` answers a wider set, so `x86_64` maps to
`amd64`, `aarch64` to `arm64`, `armv6l` and `armv7l` to `arm`, and `i686` to
`386`.

Windows does not go through `uname` at all. The operating system token is fixed:
anything installing from Windows is on `windows`, so nothing has to be detected
to choose it. The architecture comes from the environment instead, reading
`PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432` before `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`, because a 32-bit
process on a 64-bit machine reports `x86` in the second and the real
architecture only in the first, and mapping `AMD64` to `amd64` and `ARM64` to
`arm64`.

Normalizing is not enough on its own: the result has to name a target the
release actually carries, and the table below is not the product of every
operating system with every architecture. There is no `windows` `386` archive
and no `darwin` `386` or `arm` archive, so an installer that normalized its way
to one of those has found a platform with nothing to install rather than a name
to fetch. That is a refusal, and it belongs before the download rather than as a
confusing 404 from it. The same holds for a machine reporting an architecture
absent from the list entirely.

The `arm` archive is built for ARMv6, which the more common ARMv7 hardware also
runs. There is one `arm` archive rather than one per variant, so a script that
detected `arm` has a single name to build.

## Supported targets

A release carries exactly these eight archives:

| Operating system | Architectures                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Linux            | `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm`, `386`  |
| macOS            | `amd64`, `arm64`               |
| Windows          | `amd64`, `arm64`               |

The pull-request cross-build check compiles this same list. The two are kept
equal deliberately: a target that could be released without being compiled on
every pull request would break in a tag rather than in the change that broke it.

## Archive contents

Each archive contains, at its root and in no subdirectory:

- the shell binary, named at build time by `CLI_NAME` and `ws` by default
  (`ws.exe` on Windows)
- `LICENSE`
- `NOTICE`

An installer extracts the archive and moves one known path. The license and
notice travel with the binary because Apache-2.0 requires it.

## Checksums

Every release carries `checksums.txt`: one SHA-256 line per archive, in the
format `sha256sum` reads and writes.

```text
https://github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/releases/download/<tag>/checksums.txt
```

The install scripts fetch this file and verify the archive they downloaded
before extracting it. Verification failure is fatal: nothing is extracted and
nothing is installed.

The release workflows also create GitHub artifact attestations for every
archive and `checksums.txt`. These bind the files' SHA-256 digests to the
repository, tag, and workflow that published them. Releases remain drafts while
the workflows download the uploaded assets and verify their attestations.
They publish the releases only after those checks pass.

To authenticate a downloaded shell archive and checksum file, use the GitHub
CLI (replace `<tag>` with the release tag):

```sh
gh attestation verify "wso2-cli-<tag>-linux-amd64.tar.gz" \
  --repo wso2/wso2-cli \
  --signer-workflow wso2/wso2-cli/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/<tag>"
gh attestation verify checksums.txt \
  --repo wso2/wso2-cli \
  --signer-workflow wso2/wso2-cli/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/<tag>"
```

Do this before trusting the checksum file. The install scripts still verify
archive checksums but do not verify attestations, so unattended installs rely
on the GitHub release endpoint and HTTPS for publisher identity. These GitHub
attestations are not platform code signing or notarization; those remain work
for the per-platform channels described in [architecture](../architecture.md)
section 15.

## Version reporting

A released binary reports the version it was built as. The release injects the
shell version through the build-time variables in `internal/version`, as the
tag with its leading `v` removed, because the version package prefixes one for
display. It injects no protocol versions: the shell speaks the
window declared in `sdk/protocol`, the current protocol version and its
predecessor, and a release that narrowed it would cut off module releases for
users a protocol generation behind.

The release workflow proves this rather than assuming it. It downloads the
published assets back from the release page, checks that the published checksum
file is the one that was built and that it lists every archive beside it, then
extracts the Linux archive and runs the binary's `version` command. The release fails if the
binary reports the development placeholder, reports a version unrelated to the
tag, or reports a protocol window that disagrees with the one the shell's own
source declares.

## Module releases

A product module is released by pushing a tag in its own namespace, which is a
separate release from the shell's and runs
`.github/workflows/module-release.yml`. What that workflow publishes follows
the same conventions as a shell release, with the module's own names.
The `example` module is local only and is excluded from this workflow and the
public catalog; use the [local setup guide](../guides/setup-example-module.md).

```text
wso2-module-<namespace>-v<version>-<os>-<arch>.<extension>
```

The target list is the eight above, and a test holds it equal to the list the
pull-request cross-build check compiles: a module that published for fewer
would leave a user who can install the shell unable to install the module. The
extension is `tar.gz` on every platform, including the two where a shell
release publishes a zip, because the shell extracts a module archive as a
gzipped tarball and refuses anything else.

Each archive carries, at its root and in no subdirectory, the module
executable named `wso2-module-<namespace>`, with `.exe` on Windows, beside
`LICENSE` and `NOTICE`. That name is a convention rather than a catalog field:
the shell extracts a module archive expecting exactly it and refuses an
archive that does not carry it rather than searching for something executable.
Both halves of that convention read the name from one function, so it is
written down once rather than twice.

A module release publishes a `checksums.txt` covering every archive, in the
format `sha256sum` reads. It is what the catalog's digests are read back from:
the release API reports no digest, so a release whose checksum file does not
cover an archive publishes nothing that archive could be verified against, and
catalog generation fails rather than publishing an entry with no digest.
The module release workflow also attests every archive and `checksums.txt`.
Verify a downloaded module archive with `gh attestation verify` as above, using
`wso2/wso2-cli/.github/workflows/module-release.yml` as the signer workflow
and `refs/tags/<namespace>/v<version>` as the source ref.

## SDK releases

The public SDK is released by pushing a tag in the `sdk/` prefix, which
publishes nothing and uploads nothing: a Go submodule is published by its tag
alone, and `sdk/vX.Y.Z` is what makes that version fetchable from the module
proxy. `.github/workflows/sdk-release.yml` runs on such a tag and decides
whether the tag that already exists should have existed. The module release
workflow triggers on every `*/v*` tag, which matches this prefix too, and
excludes it at its first job instead: every later job needs that one, so
nothing an SDK tag triggers publishes a module archive.

The gate checks the tag names a semantic version, and refuses a major version
of two or above because that needs a module path suffix `sdk/go.mod` does not
declare. It then checks the tag against the SDK version this commit is built
around, which is the version the example module requires and the version a
scaffolded module is generated against: a tag that disagrees with it would
publish an SDK nothing in this repository is built against. It then runs the boundaries tests and builds and tests the SDK with
workspace composition disabled, which is what a consumer resolving a published
version actually does. Finally it asks the module proxy for the version that
was tagged, which both proves the version is servable and warms the proxy so
the first module to require it does not wait.

What makes an SDK version publishable is that it imports nothing under the
shell's internal tree and that it builds and tests without the workspace. The
ordinary test suite asserts both, rather than that workflow, so the same
constraints hold on every pull request. A tag is a bad place to learn either of
them for the first time, because the module proxy keeps a version forever and
there is no withdrawing one.

### Releasing a version nothing is built against yet

The gate compares the tag against the SDK version the example module
requires, so `modules/example/go.mod` has to name the new version *before* the
tag exists. Nothing can resolve that version until the tag is pushed, which
leaves a window where the checkout requires a version the proxy cannot serve.
Two things cover it, and both are narrow and self-closing.

**The workspace replaces the unpublished version.** The Go tool cannot build a
module graph that requires a version with no revision, so every build in the
repository fails, not just the ones that exercise the module. Add a versioned
replace to `go.work` for the duration:

```
replace github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/sdk v0.2.0 => ./sdk
```

`go.work` carried exactly this before `sdk/v0.1.0` and says so. Remove it once
the tag is pushed. A committed `replace` in any `go.mod` stays prohibited; the
workspace is the sanctioned place for one.

**The relocation test skips.** `TestTheReferenceModuleWorksFromAnotherRepository`
is defined by `GOWORK=off`, so the workspace replace is invisible to it by
design — it resolves the SDK from the proxy the way a product team's own
repository does. It skips while the required version is unpublished, and names
the tag that closes the window. A proxy that cannot be reached is still a
failure: an unreachable proxy read as "nothing is published" would make the test
skip itself whenever it was inconvenient.

`scripts/previous-protocol.sh` needs nothing. It already substitutes a published
version for the committed requirement, because the committed graph is the local
one.

The order is therefore: commit the requirement bump, push `sdk/vX.Y.Z`, then
drop the workspace replace. The gate runs on the tag and decides whether the tag
that already exists should have existed.

The SDK's version is not a compatibility contract. Which shells can launch a
module is decided by the protocol version, which is versioned separately,
declared in `module.json`, and checked by the module release gate below. See
[ADR 0009](../adr/0009-sdk-versioning-and-publication.md).

## The release gate

Before anything is built or uploaded, the release decides whether the module
can run on a shell that exists at all:

```sh
go run ./cmd/wso2-module-release -tag apim/v4.5.0 -gate-only
```

A module is admitted when at least one module-contract protocol version it
declares is one the released shell speaks. A module requiring a protocol newer
than the released shell speaks is refused, which enforces that the shell ships
first; so is a module speaking only a protocol the window has already left
behind, because no shell in existence could launch it either.

The refusal names both sides, the protocol the module requires and the set the
released shell speaks, so a product team can tell whether to wait for a shell
release or to change the module.

The released shell's supported set comes from `sdk/protocol`, the same single
declaration the shell itself reads when it announces what it speaks, so the
gate and the shell cannot come to disagree. The workflow asks the published
shell binary for it rather than reading this checkout, because between a
protocol bump landing on the default branch and the shell release that carries
it the two are not the same thing, and it is the shell a user can have that
decides whether a module can run. What this checkout declares is the fallback,
for the case where no shell has been released at all. The shell's own release
holds the other end of that equality: it asks the published binary what it
speaks and fails the release when the answer is not what the source declares.

This is not the gate a pull request runs. That one, in
`scripts/previous-protocol.sh`, asks whether a change to the shell or the SDK
broke the older half of the protocol window. This one asks whether a module
being released can run anywhere. They catch different failures and neither
stands in for the other.

The decision is a pure function of what the module declares and what the
released shell supports, so it is proven by tests over fixture data in
`internal/release` rather than by pushing a tag.

## Prereleases

A tag carrying a prerelease identifier, such as `v0.2.0-rc.1`, publishes as a
GitHub prerelease. Resolving "the latest release" skips prereleases, so a
release candidate never becomes the default for users who ask for the newest
version; the install scripts reach it only through their prerelease channel.

## Download URLs

```text
https://github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/releases/download/<tag>/wso2-cli-<tag>-<os>-<arch>.<extension>
https://github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/releases/download/<tag>/checksums.txt
```

The newest stable tag can be resolved without an API token by following the
redirect on `https://github.com/wso2/wso2-cli/releases/latest` and reading the
tag from the resulting URL.

## Reproducing a release without publishing

```sh
make release-snapshot
```

This builds every artifact into `dist/`, including `checksums.txt`, and
publishes nothing. It is how a change to the release configuration is checked
before a tag exists.

A snapshot differs from a real release in two ways worth knowing before reading
its output: the archive names carry the most recent tag in the checkout, which
is `v0.0.0` when there is none, while the binary inside reports the next patch
version suffixed with `-snapshot`. Everything else is what a tag produces: the
target list, the archive formats, the archive contents, and the checksum
file.

`make release-check` validates the configuration without building.
