# WSO2 CLI shell commands

**Status:** Proposed reference
**Related:** [Product requirements](../product-requirements.md),
[architecture](../architecture.md)

This reference describes the proposed shared `wso2` shell commands. It does not
represent an available production interface. Product operations belong to
product modules, such as `wso2 api`, `wso2 identity`, `wso2 integration`, and
`wso2 agent`.

The distinction between catalog refresh and module binary update remains an
open decision. The lifecycle command names below are therefore provisional.

These are built: `wso2 context create <name>`, `wso2 context use <context>`,
`wso2 context list`, `wso2 context current`,
`wso2 identity add-product <identity> <namespace>`, `wso2 identity list`,
`wso2 login`, `wso2 login --url <issuer> --client-id <id>`, `wso2 logout`,
`wso2 whoami`, `wso2 doctor`, `wso2 module available`, `wso2 module list`,
`wso2 module install <module>`, `wso2 module install <module>@<version>`,
`wso2 module install <module> --channel <channel>`,
`wso2 module update <module>`, `wso2 module update --all`,
`wso2 module remove <module>`, `wso2 config list`, `wso2 config get <key>`,
`wso2 config set <key> <value>`, `wso2 org current`, and `wso2 org use
<organization>`. The
[module catalog](module-catalog.md) reference describes what they select, what
they verify, how a channel and a pin are recorded per module, and how each
refusal is reported.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wso2 help` | Shows the root command tree and help for a command. |
| `wso2 version` | Shows the shell, protocol, and installed module versions. |
| `wso2 login` | Authenticates the selected context using its configured method. |
| `wso2 login --url <issuer> --client-id <id>` | Logs in against a named issuer and creates the identity and the context it authenticated, reporting both names. `--context <name>` names them; without it the identity name is derived from the issuer host, and an issuer whose host cannot make a legal name is refused with `contexts.identity_name_underivable`. An identity of that name whose issuer and client ID both match is reused; one that differs in either is refused with `contexts.identity_exists` and never replaced. The first context created becomes the selected one. Nothing is written unless the login succeeded. Omitting `--client-id` prompts in an interactive terminal and is refused with `shell.missing_required_flag` under `--no-input`. |
| `wso2 logout` | Ends the session of the identity the selected context names: asks the identity provider to revoke its refresh token, and removes the shell-owned session that every context sharing that credential reference reaches. |
| `wso2 whoami` | Built today: shows the selected context, the identity it authenticates as, the organization, the session's subject, and the session's own state, all read from local state with no network call. With no context selected it says so and exits 0. With a context selected but no stored session it says so and names `wso2 login`. A stored session is reported present with its expiry either as the issuer's disclosed refresh-token lifetime or, when the issuer disclosed none, as not stated — never as the shorter-lived access token's own expiry. A disclosed lifetime that has passed is reported expired. A session stored before this field existed reports its subject as unknown rather than blank. |
| `wso2 org` | With no subcommand, prints this family's help on standard output and exits 0: naming a family without a subcommand is an incomplete command, not a failed one, and every subcommand it names works. The help names `current` and `use`. A subcommand the family does not have is a different case and is still refused with `shell.unknown_command` and the usage exit class (#133), so a typo is never reported to a script as success. |
| `wso2 org list` | Deferred (#112): no control-plane endpoint for enumerating organizations exists yet, and listing would need an access token before an organization is chosen, which the auth broker refuses. Typing it is refused as an unknown `wso2 org` subcommand, naming `current` and `use` as what the family supports. |
| `wso2 org use <organization>` | Built today: sets the `Organization` field on the selected context through `contexts.Update`, and names which context it edited. The auth broker binds a minted token to a context's `Organization` and refuses when it is empty, so a session already signed in under the previous organization no longer matches — the command warns about that on standard error, in both renderings. It writes nothing, and does not migrate, invalidate, or re-mint a session. Refused with `shell.no_context_configured` when no context exists to edit. |
| `wso2 org current` | Built today: shows the organization the selected context runs within, read from `contexts.Context.Organization`. With no context configured it reports that state and exits 0, worded exactly as `wso2 context current`. A configured context with no organization set says so distinctly, rather than reporting the same blank field either state would otherwise share. |
| `wso2 context` | With no subcommand, prints this family's help on standard output and exits 0: naming a family without a subcommand is an incomplete command, not a failed one, and every subcommand it names works. The help names `create`, `current`, `list` and `use`. A subcommand the family does not have is a different case and is still refused with `shell.unknown_command` and the usage exit class (#133), so a typo is never reported to a script as success. |
| `wso2 context create <name>` | Creates a context naming an identity with `--identity`, and optionally an organization and project with `--organization` and `--project`. It writes no credential and makes no network call, so an unreachable issuer or a misspelled organization is reported by the command that needs it rather than here. Creating a context whose name is taken is refused. The first context created becomes the selected one. |
| `wso2 context list` | Lists saved cloud and on-premises contexts, marking the selected one. |
| `wso2 context use <context>` | Selects the context used by default for later commands. |
| `wso2 context current` | Shows the active context. |
| `wso2 identity` | With no subcommand, prints this family's help on standard output and exits 0: naming a family without a subcommand is an incomplete command, not a failed one, and every subcommand it names works. The help names `add-product` and `list`. A subcommand the family does not have is a different case and is still refused with `shell.unknown_command` and the usage exit class (#133), so a typo is never reported to a script as success. |
| `wso2 identity add-product <identity> <namespace>` | Records a product the identity reaches, with `--endpoint`, and optionally `--audience` and a comma-separated `--scopes`. It modifies an identity `wso2 login` wrote and creates no identity and no context: logging in is the only thing that creates an identity. Nothing is written to the secure store and no network call is made, so the record is an assertion that the login's session reaches the product, checked by the first command that needs it. A namespace the identity already records is refused with `contexts.product_exists`; `--replace` overwrites it, replacing the whole record rather than merging with it. An endpoint embedding user information is refused, and the rejected value is not echoed. |
| `wso2 identity list` | Lists the identities and, for each, the products it reaches. It names no credential and reads nothing from the secure store. |
| `wso2 config` | With no subcommand, prints this family's help on standard output and exits 0: naming a family without a subcommand is an incomplete command, not a failed one, and every subcommand it names works. The help names `list`, `get` and `set`. A subcommand the family does not have is a different case and is still refused with `shell.unknown_command` and the usage exit class (#133), so a typo is never reported to a script as success. |
| `wso2 config list` | Built today: shows every key in the closed set of shell preferences — the default output mode and the catalog origin override — and whether each is currently configured. |
| `wso2 config get <key>` | Built today: shows one shell preference. `key` must be one of `output`, `catalog-origin`; any other value is refused with `config.unknown_key`, naming the valid keys. |
| `wso2 config set <key> <value>` | Built today: changes one shell preference. An unknown key is refused the same way `config get` refuses one; a value a key does not accept is refused with `config.invalid_value`, naming what is acceptable (`table` or `json` for `output`; an absolute http or https URL for `catalog-origin`). Each preference is the lowest-precedence source for what it governs: `--output` wins over a configured output mode, and `WSO2_CLI_CATALOG_ORIGIN` wins over a configured catalog origin — a saved preference can never override either. `output` governs exactly the commands that accept `--output`: `wso2 whoami`, `wso2 doctor`, `wso2 logout`, and the `context`, `identity`, `config` and `org` families. It does not reach `wso2 version` or the `module` family, which render fixed prose and refuse `--output` with `shell.unsupported_flag`; a preference that silently did nothing for them would be a worse contract than a flag refused out loud. A colour preference is not in this set: `output.ColorEnabled` has no production caller yet, so a key that claimed to govern colour would change nothing observable; it is the obvious first key to add once something renders in colour. |
| `wso2 update` | Applies the approved installation-channel policy for root shell updates. |
| `wso2 module` | With no subcommand, prints this family's help on standard output and exits 0: naming a family without a subcommand is an incomplete command, not a failed one, and every subcommand it names works. The help names `available`, `install`, `list`, `remove` and `update`. A subcommand the family does not have is a different case and is still refused with `shell.unknown_command` and the usage exit class (#133), so a typo is never reported to a script as success. |
| `wso2 module available` | Lists official modules the module catalog publishes. |
| `wso2 module install <module>` | Installs the latest compatible stable release of a module. |
| `wso2 module install <module>@<version>` | Installs an exact compatible module version. |
| `wso2 module list` | Lists installed modules, versions, and update availability. |
| `wso2 module info <module>` | Shows catalog, compatibility, and installation information. |
| `wso2 module update <module>` | Updates one product module. Naming a module is already an explicit target, so this does not prompt; `--dry-run` still reports what it would do without changing anything. A module the catalog publishes no version of on its followed channel — withdrawn, renamed, or moved to a channel this install no longer follows — is reported by name rather than called current, since the catalog cannot say whether the installed version is current when it does not publish the module at all; this does not change the exit status. |
| `wso2 module update --all` | Built today: updates every installed product module that has a newer version on its followed channel, skipping a pinned one. Being unbounded, it prompts for confirmation before moving anything; `--yes` skips the prompt, `--dry-run` reports what it would do without changing anything, and `--no-input` (or `WSO2_NO_INPUT`) refuses rather than prompt. Refuses `shell.non_interactive` when it may not prompt and `--yes` was not given — either because `--no-input` or `WSO2_NO_INPUT` asked that nothing prompt, or because standard input is not a terminal; the refusal names the control that fired and offers the one way out that applies to it, and `shell.conflicting_arguments` for `--yes` with `--dry-run`. A module the catalog publishes no version of on its followed channel — withdrawn, renamed, or moved to a channel this install no longer follows — is reported by name rather than called current, since the catalog cannot say whether the installed version is current when it does not publish the module at all; this does not change the exit status, so a scheduled `--all` run does not start failing the moment one module goes unpublished upstream. |
| `wso2 module verify <module>` | Verifies an installed module and its receipt. |
| `wso2 module rollback <module>` | Reactivates a retained compatible version. |
| `wso2 module remove <module>` | Built today: removes one installed module, leaving configuration and credentials alone. Prompts for confirmation after confirming the module is installed; `--yes` skips the prompt, `--dry-run` reports what it would remove without removing anything, and `--no-input` (or `WSO2_NO_INPUT`) refuses rather than prompt. Refuses `shell.module_not_installed` before any prompt when the module is not installed, `shell.non_interactive` when it may not prompt and `--yes` was not given — either because `--no-input` or `WSO2_NO_INPUT` asked that nothing prompt, or because standard input is not a terminal; the refusal names the control that fired and offers the one way out that applies to it, and `shell.conflicting_arguments` for `--yes` with `--dry-run`. |
| `wso2 module install --file <module.wso2module>` | Installs one module from an offline file. |
| `wso2 bundle create` | Creates a platform-specific, self-installing offline bundle from catalog releases. |
| `wso2 bundle inspect <file>` | Shows bundle contents without installing it. |
| `wso2 bundle install <file>` | Imports a bundle when the WSO2 CLI is already installed. |
| `wso2 doctor` | Built today: checks that the context document is valid, that the OS secure store is reachable, and that the selected context has a stored session. `--online` adds a fourth check, module catalog reachability; without it, `wso2 doctor` makes no network call. On an unconfigured machine, the secure-store and session checks report not-applicable rather than failure; on a context document that fails to decode or validate, the session check reports not-applicable too, because no credential reference can be resolved from it, while the secure-store check still runs since it never reads the document. On a configured context with no stored session — the state a completed `wso2 logout` leaves behind — the session check reports none, with the `wso2 login` pointer in its recovery column, rather than failure: being logged out is a normal state, not a health fault. A session that is stored but cannot be read still fails. Exits 0 when every check passes, is not-applicable, or reports none, otherwise the exit class of the most severe failing check, in this rank: secure-store, then the document, then the session, then (only under `--online`) the catalog — a rank this command defines and not the numeric order of the exit classes those checks carry. Receipt, module integrity, compatibility, and protocol status are not built yet; see [architecture](../architecture.md#14-operational-behavior-and-recovery). |

`project` commands are intentionally not included yet. Product-specific
projects, deployment, and runtime operations remain within their product
modules.

On a fresh air-gapped machine, the user runs the transferred platform-specific
offline bundle directly; no `wso2` command exists yet. `wso2 bundle install`
is only for a machine where the shell is already installed. The administrator
must establish trust in the bootstrap before execution through platform signing
on Windows or macOS, or detached-signature verification on Linux.

## Exit classes

The shell alone decides the process exit status: a module returns a typed
problem and the shell maps its category to one of these classes. The mapping is
a stable contract for automation, so a script may branch on the status without
parsing any output.

| Status | Class | What produces it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Success | The command completed. |
| `64` | Usage | Invalid arguments, flags, or configuration, including a malformed context document. |
| `69` | Module trust | A module integrity, signature, platform, or compatibility failure. |
| `70` | Module process | A protocol violation, a module process that failed to launch or crashed, or an unreachable module catalog origin (including `wso2 doctor --online`'s catalog check). |
| `75` | Product service | A failure the product service itself reported. |
| `77` | Authentication policy | An authentication or broker policy failure, including no context selected, and a missing or expired session. |

An unrecognized problem category is reported as a module process failure, `70`,
rather than as success.

One command opts out of the `77` class on purpose: `wso2 reference status`
reports a broker refusal as fields of its result and exits `0`, because
whether access was granted is the question it exists to answer, and a report
that cannot say "no" cannot answer it. A gate that must fail without access
runs `wso2 reference call` or `wso2 reference whoami`, which keep the `77`
class for the same refusal.

## Non-interactive use

`--no-input` declares that nothing may prompt, open a browser, or wait for a
human. `WSO2_NO_INPUT`, set to any non-empty value, does the same for every
invocation in the environment. A job that sets either wants to fail fast on a
misconfigured identity rather than hang until its own timeout.

A browser or device login under `--no-input` is refused with
`auth.non_interactive` and exit class `77`. Automation authenticates with a
client-credentials identity instead, which acquires access inline with no login
step.

## Sample output

### Version

```text
$ wso2 version
WSO2 CLI          v0.1.0
Protocol          v2, v1
Platform          darwin/arm64

Installed modules
NAME          VERSION
api           v0.9.0
agent         v1.2.0
integration   v0.4.0
```

### Active identity

```text
$ wso2 whoami
Context          cloud-us
Identity         acme-cloud
Organization     acme
Subject          jane@example.com
Session          present
Session expiry   2026-11-15T09:00:00Z
```

`Session expiry` reads `not stated by the issuer` when the identity provider
discloses no refresh-token lifetime, which is the common case and not an
error; it is never the access token's own, much shorter, expiry. With no
context selected, `wso2 whoami` says so and exits 0. With a context selected
but no stored session, it names `wso2 login` instead of a `Session expiry`
row. `--output json` renders the same facts as a JSON object.

### First login against a self-hosted issuer

```text
$ wso2 login --url https://idp.customer.example --client-id wso2-cli \
    --context customer

Logged in to the "customer" context.
Subject    ops
Email      ops@customer.example
Products   none configured

Created identity "customer" and context "customer".
It is the first context, so it is now the selected one.

No products are configured for this identity. A self-hosted deployment is not
discoverable, so each product's endpoint has to be recorded:

  wso2 identity add-product customer <namespace> \
      --endpoint <url> --audience <resource-id> --scopes <list>
```

The authorization URL is written to the diagnostic stream, not to this one: it
is an instruction to act on rather than the command's result, so a caller
redirecting standard output still sees it.

### Ending a session

```text
$ wso2 logout

Ended the session for the "cloud-us" context.
Context      cloud-us
Identity     acme-cloud
Session      ended
Revocation   confirmed
Shared with  cloud-us

The identity provider accepted the request to revoke this session's refresh token.

A browser single-sign-on session at the identity provider is unaffected by this
command, so a later login may not prompt for credentials.
```

`Revocation` is `confirmed` when the identity provider accepted the request,
`not-attempted` when it publishes no revocation endpoint and so was never asked,
and `failed` when it was asked and did not accept, or could not be reached. The
shell-owned session is removed under all three, and the command succeeds under
all three; what changes is only what it claims. `--output json` renders the same
fields as a JSON object, which is the only way a script can read which of the
three happened. See
[ADR 0010](../adr/0010-best-effort-revocation-on-session-end.md).

### Context

```text
$ wso2 context create cloud-us --identity acme-cloud --organization acme

Created the "cloud-us" context.
Context        cloud-us
Identity       acme-cloud
Organization   acme
Project
Selected       yes

It is the first context, so it is now the selected one. Run wso2 context use
<name> to select another.

$ wso2 context list
CURRENT   CONTEXT    IDENTITY     ORGANIZATION   PROJECT
*         cloud-us   acme-cloud   acme

$ wso2 context current
Context        cloud-us
Identity       acme-cloud
Organization   acme
Project
```

An identity is created by `wso2 login`, not by a command of its own, so
`--identity` names one that already exists and a name that does not is refused
with `contexts.unknown_identity`.

### Module inventory

```text
$ wso2 module list
MODULE        INSTALLED   CHANNEL   UPDATE
api           v0.9.0      stable    current
agent         v1.2.0      stable    v1.3.0 available
integration   v0.4.0      —         pinned to v0.4.0

1 module(s) have an update available. Run wso2 module update --all to take them.
```

CHANNEL names the channel a module follows for updates; it shows `—` for a
module installed at an exact version with no channel chosen, such as
`integration` above. A pin overrides the channel — it is what makes a pinned
prerelease installable without putting the module on that channel — so there
is no channel to name while the pin holds, and the blank cell is not a
prediction that the module would move to stable once unpinned: `wso2 module
install integration` without `@<version>` records whatever channel that
command names, stable by default, which need not be the channel the pinned
version actually came from.

Credentials are never shown by these commands. Tokens are stored separately in
the operating system's secure credential store.
