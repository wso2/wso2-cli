// into the flow: what a user gets is the two streams, the exit class, what
// landed in the secure store, and what the product service was shown.

// timing is observed — "the shell did not poll faster than I asked it to" is a
// fact about the deployment, and asserting it from there cannot be satisfied by
// a shell that merely holds the right number in a variable.

// deviceDeployment installs the standard login deployment as a device identity.
