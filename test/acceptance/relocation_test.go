// what the SDK release gate compares its tag against, so the requirement has to
// name the new version before the tag exists, and the tag makes it fetchable
// moments later. What this skip buys is that the commit in between builds and
// its suite is honest, rather than red for a reason unrelated to the change.
//
// A proxy that cannot be reached is a failure rather than an empty answer, on
