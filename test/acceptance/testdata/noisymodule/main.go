// Command noisymodule is a conforming module that misbehaves on purpose, used
// by the shell's acceptance tests.
//
// The example module has nothing to warn about and never fails, so it cannot
// demonstrate that structured output survives a talkative module or that the
// shell reports a module which answers and then exits uncleanly. This one
// writes to standard error before and after returning its result, and claims
// the same namespace and version, so the shell resolves and launches it exactly
// as it would the example module.
//
// It is steered by files placed beside its own executable rather than by
// arguments or environment variables, because the shell launches a module with
// neither: it passes no arguments and sanitizes the environment to nothing.
// Writing a control file also leaves the executable unchanged, so the receipt
// digest still matches and the module is still launched.
//
// The recognized files are:
//
//	exit-uncleanly      exit with a non-zero status after answering
//	report-environment  write this process's whole environment to standard
//	                    error, so a test can prove what the shell passed on
