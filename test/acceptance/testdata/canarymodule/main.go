// Command canarymodule is a conforming module that discloses everything it can
// reach, used by the shell's acceptance canary scan.
//
// The example module is written to be well behaved, so it proves only that a
// careful module keeps a credential safe. The stronger claim the architecture
// proof has to make is that a careless or hostile module cannot disclose one
// even when it tries, because it was never given anything to disclose. This
// module is that adversary: it takes every value the shell hands a module —
// process arguments, the whole environment, the invocation, the non-secret
// context, and the access it is granted — and pushes all of it out through both
// channels a module has, its diagnostics and its result.
//
// The scan then reads that output looking for the harness's canary credential.
// Finding it anywhere is a disclosure; finding the granted token instead is the
// boundary working, because a token is what a module is meant to hold.
//
// It claims the example namespace and version so the shell resolves and
// launches it exactly as it would the example module. It is fixture code and
// never ships.
