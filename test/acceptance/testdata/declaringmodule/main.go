// Command declaringmodule is a conforming module that declares its command tree,
// used to prove the shell parses a product command line against what the module
// says it accepts.
//
// The example module cannot play this part. It is built outside this
// workspace by the relocation test, against the published SDK, which is how the
// architecture proves a product module can live in another repository — so it
// cannot use an SDK API until that API is released. This module is built from
// the workspace and is free to.
//
// Its commands do nothing but report what reached them. What is under test is
// the line as the shell split it: which words became the command, which
// arguments were forwarded, and which flags the shell kept for itself.
