// Package smoke configures the live login runs and the Asgardeo experiments.
//
// The runs themselves are guarded by the `smoke` build tag and never execute in
// the default gate: they open a real browser, sign a real person in, and write
// to the operating system's secure store. What lives here, untagged, is the
// part that can be proven without a deployment — reading the environment that
// names one, and building the context document a run installs. That split is
// deliberate. A misread variable or a document the shell refuses to load are
// the two ways a live run wastes a human's attention, and both are decided
// before any browser opens.
//
// See test/smoke/RUNNING.md for what to export and docs/guides/setup-*.md for
// how to register the application the variables describe.
