# Running the live smoke and the empirical experiments

**Status:** Working draft
**Related:** the per-product setup guides —
[Asgardeo](../../docs/guides/setup-asgardeo.md),
[Identity Server 7.x](../../docs/guides/setup-identity-server-7.x.md),
[ThunderID](../../docs/guides/setup-thunder.md) — and
[the login errors table](../../docs/reference/commands.md). The empirical
verdicts this file used to point at a research document for now live in
"Measured product verdicts" below.

Everything in this directory except `config.go` is behind the `smoke` build tag.
The default gate never builds it, so nothing here can open a browser, contact a
deployment, or touch the operating system's secure store during `go test ./...`
or `scripts/acceptance.sh`.

These runs need a human. They open a real browser and wait for a real sign-in.

## What to export

Register the application first — there is a walkthrough per product:
[Asgardeo](../../docs/guides/setup-asgardeo.md),
[Identity Server 7.x](../../docs/guides/setup-identity-server-7.x.md),
[ThunderID](../../docs/guides/setup-thunder.md) — then describe it with these
variables.

Describing it once in a file beats re-exporting it into every shell. Copy
[`env.example`](env.example) and fill it in:

```sh
cp test/smoke/env.example test/smoke/.env
make smoke-login
```

Both live targets source `test/smoke/.env` when it exists and print which file
they read. Keep one per deployment and name the one you want:

```sh
make smoke-login SMOKE_ENV=test/smoke/asgardeo.env
```

## Measuring what logout achieves

`make smoke-logout` signs in, ends the session, and reports what that achieved
at the issuer. It answers two questions no document in this repository answers
yet, one verdict line each:

- **Does the deployment let this public client revoke a session?** —
  `advertised and accepted`, `not advertised`, or `advertised and refused`. The
  shell is a
  public client with no secret, and a deployment requiring a confidential one at
  its revocation endpoint refuses it.
- **Did revoking the refresh token end the session?** — measured by presenting
  the token afterwards, because an accepted revocation proves only that the
  deployment was told. RFC 7009 requires a server to answer an unknown token
  exactly as it answers a live one.

**Every verdict is a pass**, the inconclusive one included. A deployment that
publishes no revocation endpoint is not a broken deployment, and the shell
reports that outcome rather than claiming a guarantee it did not obtain — see
[ADR 0010](../../docs/adr/0010-best-effort-revocation-on-session-end.md). An
answer the run cannot classify is recorded as
`inconclusive` rather than failing, because it is a fact about the deployment
and not a defect.

The run stops only where the measurement cannot be trusted or the shell failed
its own half:

- the refresh token does not renew **before** logout, so nothing later can be
  attributed to revocation;
- the deployment rotates refresh tokens and the replacement cannot be stored,
  which would leave logout revoking a token the deployment had already retired;
- the shell leaves the session in the operating system's secure store;
- the shell reports an outcome the deployment's own discovery document
  contradicts — a confirmed revocation where no endpoint is advertised, or no
  attempt where one is.

Run it once per product and record the lines against that product in
"Measured product verdicts" below:

```sh
make smoke-logout SMOKE_ENV=test/smoke/asgardeo.env
```

Nothing parses these files. Go has no dotenv convention and this module has no
dependency that would add one — the file is an ordinary shell fragment, so
sourcing it yourself does exactly what `make` does, which is what to do when
running `go test` directly:

```sh
. test/smoke/asgardeo.env
go test -tags smoke -count=1 -v -timeout 30m ./test/smoke/ -run TestLoginSmoke
```

Sourcing overwrites what the calling shell already exported, so the file you
name always wins and switching deployments does not need a fresh terminal. That
matters most in the case that would otherwise be baffling: a leftover export
from the last deployment quietly outranking the file you just edited.

`*.env` is ignored by git. Nothing secret belongs in one anyway — a public
client has no secret — and a client secret in a file this casual is a mistake
worth avoiding on purpose.

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_ISSUER` | yes | The issuer exactly as its discovery document states it. Asgardeo: `https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org>/oauth2/token`. Identity Server 7.x: `https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token`. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_CLIENT_ID` | yes | The registered public client. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_AUDIENCE` | yes | The API resource identifier brokered access must be bound to. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_SCOPE` | yes | Permissions, separated by spaces or commas. The narrowing experiment needs at least two. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_TENANT` | no | The identity's home organization. Left unset, the smoke context names no organization. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_ENDPOINT` | no | The product endpoint recorded on the identity. Defaults to the issuer's origin. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_IDENTITY_TYPE` | no | `cloud` (default) or `onprem`. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_UNREGISTERED_PORT` | no | The loopback port the any-port experiment binds. Defaults to `16000`. Must be outside 10425-10428. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_DEADLINE` | no | How long an **experiment** waits at the browser. Defaults to `3m`. It does not reach `make smoke-login`, which signs in through `wso2 login` and carries the shell's own five-minute deadline. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_PROVIDER` | no | The identity provider behind the issuer: `asgardeo`, `identity-server`, or `thunder`. Left unset, the run describes a deployment that binds audiences from the application's registration, which is the first two. **Required for ThunderID**, which binds them per request and refuses a login that names no resource. A name this shell does not read fails rather than skipping. |
| `WSO2_SMOKE_CI_CLIENT_ID` | CI run only | The confidential client `make smoke-ci` presents. Its **secret** is not named here; see below. |
| `WSO2_EMPIRICAL` | experiments only | Set to `1` to opt into the experiments. `make empirical-asgardeo` and `make empirical-thunder` set it for you. |

### The client secret, and why it is not in the table above

`make smoke-ci` authenticates as a confidential client, so it needs that
client's secret. Export it in the shell you run from:

```sh
export WSO2_SMOKE_CLIENT_SECRET='<the confidential client's secret>'
make smoke-ci
```

The variable's name is fixed in `config.go`, beside the secure-store reference
that is already fixed there, and it is deliberately absent from
`test/smoke/env.example`. A deployment description is a file people copy, keep,
and send to each other; naming the secret's variable in one is an invitation to
paste the value beside the name, and `*.env` being git-ignored is a weaker
protection than the value never being written down at all.

This is also the production contract, exercised as shipped: a context names an
environment variable, the broker reads it into process memory for one grant, and
it never reaches shell state, the secure store, or the module's environment.

Without it, `make smoke-ci` skips and says so.

With none of them set, both targets skip and say which variables they wanted.
That is the expected result on a machine with no deployment:

```
--- SKIP: TestLoginSmoke (0.00s)
    no live deployment is configured: set WSO2_SMOKE_ISSUER, WSO2_SMOKE_CLIENT_ID,
    WSO2_SMOKE_AUDIENCE, WSO2_SMOKE_SCOPE (see test/smoke/RUNNING.md)
```

A variable that is set but unreadable — a malformed issuer, a port that is not a
number — fails instead of skipping. A run that skipped over a deployment someone
believed they had configured would be worse than one that stopped.

## The smoke run

```sh
cp test/smoke/env.example test/smoke/.env   # then fill it in
make smoke-login
```

A browser opens; sign in. The run then proves four things in order: `wso2 login`
exits zero, the refresh token is readable back out of the operating system's
secure store, the broker derives an access token from that session, and it
derives a second one carrying strictly less than the session holds:

```
LOGIN SMOKE: granted  — asked for everything the session carries, received access of
                        1261 characters bound to "example-status" carrying
                        [example:status:read example:status:write]
LOGIN SMOKE: narrowed — asked for one permission out of the 2 the session holds,
                        received access of 1230 characters bound to "example-status"
                        carrying [example:status:read]
```

The second line is the one that measures anything about narrowing. When the
request is every permission the session already carries, the shell compares the
issued scopes against an identical request, so that check holds however the
deployment behaved — a deployment that disregarded the request entirely would
still be reported as granted. Only a strict subset can fail, and a strict subset
is what a module actually asks for.

The two acquisitions run as two separate invocations because the shell allows a
module one acquisition per command and refuses a second with
`auth.already_granted`. Against a deployment that rotates refresh tokens, the
second acquisition also proves the first persisted its replacement.

Run it once per deployment. Two things change between them, and only one of them
is obvious:

```sh
export WSO2_SMOKE_ISSUER='https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token'
export WSO2_SMOKE_IDENTITY_TYPE=onprem
```

The other is the audience. On Asgardeo it has to be the **client ID**, because
that is the only value Asgardeo ever puts in an access token's `aud`. On
Identity Server it is the **API resource identifier**, which reaches `aud` once
the identifier is in the application's audience list. Section 1 of
[the Asgardeo](../../docs/guides/setup-asgardeo.md),
[Identity Server](../../docs/guides/setup-identity-server-7.x.md), and
[ThunderID](../../docs/guides/setup-thunder.md) walkthroughs each state their
own answer and the measurement behind it. This is the main reason to keep a
file per deployment rather than editing one in place.

A local Identity Server or Thunder deployment also has to be trusted by the
operating system before any of this can reach it — see section 3 of its
walkthrough.

### The one refusal that is not a failure

If the deployment will not prove a grant is exactly what was asked for, the
acquisition step reports:

```
LOGIN SMOKE: refused auth.narrowing_unavailable — asked for one permission out of
the 2 the session holds, and the shell would not hand the module a grant it could
not prove was exactly what it asked for. Login and session persistence passed;
this refusal is the designed outcome, not a failure.
  auth_policy: auth.narrowing_unavailable: the "example" module asked for the
  permissions example:status:read and the deployment issued
  example:status:read, example:status:write
```

and the run passes. The shell does not hand a module more authority than it
asked for, so refusing is the correct behavior, not a fallback. The walkthrough's
troubleshooting section explains what to change in the registration if you want
a grant instead.

**The indented line is the one to read.** The sentence above it is the same for
every refusal, because `auth.narrowing_unavailable` covers five distinct causes
and a summary naming one of them would be wrong four times out of five. The
indented line is the shell's own message and says which one happened. The
example above is a deployment that disregarded the request — it answered a
one-permission request with both. The other four read:

| The indented line says | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| refused to narrow this session | the token endpoint answered `invalid_scope`. Not always the deployment's verdict: an authorization policy the signed-in user does not satisfy answers identically. See the `rejected` narrowing verdict below. |
| in a form the shell cannot check | the access token is opaque, so nothing about it can be proven |
| did not state which permissions it issued | neither the response nor the token named a scope |
| not bound to the *audience* | the token is real but carries a different `aud` — on Asgardeo, almost always because the audience is set to the API resource rather than the client ID |

The login errors table in [`docs/reference/commands.md`](../../docs/reference/commands.md)
tabulates the same five against what to change in the registration.

Read which acquisition refused, too. On the **narrowed** one it is a statement
about the deployment: it would not issue a token carrying strictly less than the
session. On the **broad** one it is almost always the registration instead —
most often an audience the deployment never binds — and the run stops there
rather than repeating one finding twice.

## The experiments

Run once per deployment, ever. They answer the two questions no public source
could settle: whether any-port loopback redirect URIs work, and whether the
refresh grant honors a narrower scope. "Measured product verdicts" below
records what they found.

```sh
make empirical-asgardeo
```

Two browser sign-ins, one per experiment. Each prints a single verdict line to
standard output:

```
ASGARDEO ANY-PORT LOOPBACK: rejected
  deployment: https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org>/oauth2/token

ASGARDEO REFRESH NARROWING: honored
  deployment: https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org>/oauth2/token
```

The `ASGARDEO` prefix is the question's name, not a claim about where the answer
came from — the `deployment:` line under each verdict is what says that. Record
only verdicts whose deployment line names the deployment you mean to record.

### Reading the any-port verdict

- `supported` — the deployment waived the port when matching the loopback
  redirect URI, as RFC 8252 section 7.3 asks and as Identity Server documents
  from 6.0.0 onwards.
- `rejected` — exact-match only. The flow never returned to the listener.
  **Corroborate this one before recording it.** `rejected` is the catch-all
  branch: it is what the experiment says for *any* login that did not complete
  and was not a discovery failure. A closed browser, a denied consent, an
  unfinished sign-in, or a code exchange the deployment refused all land here
  too, and none of them answers the question. Only record `rejected` if the
  browser actually displayed a redirect-URI-mismatch error. If it displayed a
  normal sign-in page, the run measured your attention span, not the deployment.
- `inconclusive (auth.discovery_failed)` — the port was busy or the issuer was
  unreadable. The experiment never reached its question.

### Reading the narrowing verdict

- `honored` — the deployment issued a token carrying exactly the one permission
  asked for. RFC 6749 section 6 behavior.
- `honored (protocol scopes retained)` — the deployment narrowed the product
  permissions to exactly the one asked for, and kept `openid` and
  `offline_access` in its answer. **The narrowing question is answered yes.**
  Record it as honored, with the qualifier. The shell still refuses the grant,
  because a module must not receive permissions it did not ask for — that
  refusal is about the shell's contract with modules, not about whether the
  deployment narrows. The login that establishes the session always requests
  `openid` and `offline_access` alongside the product permissions, so a
  deployment echoing them back is ordinary, not a finding.
- `ignored` — a token came back carrying a materially different permission set:
  a product permission that was not asked for, or one that was asked for and is
  missing. Protocol scopes are already excluded before this verdict is reached,
  so `ignored` means the deployment really did disregard the request. The line
  above the verdict prints both permission sets; copy them into "Measured
  product verdicts" below along with the verdict.
- `rejected` — the token endpoint answered `invalid_scope`.
  **Corroborate this one before recording it.** `invalid_scope` is also exactly
  what the token endpoint answers when the application's API resource
  authorization carries an authorization policy (RBAC) that the signing-in user
  does not satisfy — a registration gap, not a protocol finding about the
  deployment. The first live Asgardeo run hit it twice before producing a real
  verdict, and from the verdict line alone it is indistinguishable from a
  genuine "this deployment refuses to narrow" result. Before recording `rejected`, go to the application's
  Authorization tab and confirm the resource's policy reads `No Authorization
  Policy`, or, if it reads `Role Based Access Control (RBAC)`, that the
  signing-in user holds a role granting every scope the resource lists. Only
  once that is confirmed does `invalid_scope` say something about the
  deployment rather than about who was signed in when the experiment ran.
  Recording it without checking puts a false claim about Asgardeo into
  "Measured product verdicts" below, whose whole purpose is being
  trustworthy about exactly that.
- `inconclusive (opaque access token)` — the deployment issues opaque access
  tokens, so nothing can be proven about what they carry. Configure the
  application to issue JWT access tokens and run it again; until then this
  question has no answer on this deployment.
- `inconclusive (deployment stated no scope)` — a token came back, but neither
  the response nor the token named a permission, so there is nothing to compare
  against the request. Not a finding about narrowing: it says the deployment
  declined to state what it issued. Check the API resource is authorized on the
  application with its scopes selected, then run it again.
- `inconclusive (unrecognized narrowing refusal)` — the deployment refused and
  the refusal did not name permissions, so which of the narrowing causes it was
  cannot be read off it. Record nothing from this one. The run's own output
  carries the underlying message; the login errors table in
  [`docs/reference/commands.md`](../../docs/reference/commands.md) maps it to
  what to change.
- `inconclusive (audience not bound)` — a token came back that is not bound to
  the configured audience. On Asgardeo this is not a registration defect to
  fix: Asgardeo binds a JWT access token's `aud` claim to the **client ID**,
  never to the API resource identifier whose scopes the token carries, and this
  is not configurable — the application's Protocol tab exposes an Audience
  field only under **ID Token**, and the Access Token section has no audience
  control at all. See section 1 of
  [the Asgardeo walkthrough](../../docs/guides/setup-asgardeo.md), and
  "Measured product verdicts" below for the finding this experiment
  established. The remedy is to set `WSO2_SMOKE_AUDIENCE`
  here, and `products.<namespace>.audience` in a real context document, to the
  **client ID** — that is the only value Asgardeo ever puts in `aud`. On a
  deployment that does bind tokens to API resources, the resource identifier is
  the correct value to configure, and an unbound token there means the resource
  is not authorized on the application instead. Whether Identity Server 7.x
  behaves like Asgardeo here is not yet measured.

### Recording the verdicts

A new measurement goes in a GitHub issue with the date, the verdict, and the
deployment line the run printed. The table below carries only what the smoke
tests assert; a verdict that changes a decision is summarised in the ADR that
rests on it (ADR 0001).

## Measured product verdicts

Moved here from the now-deleted research record, which asked these questions
of Asgardeo, Identity Server 7.3.0, and ThunderID and described how a live run
should produce and record an answer — the how is the rest of this file.

Background fact behind the rotation handling above: refresh token rotation is
opt-in on the shared Asgardeo/Identity Server platform (off by default, so the
same refresh token is normally reused across renewals; enabling "Renew refresh
token" invalidates the old one on each exchange, with a short graceful-reuse
window when that is also turned on).

### Asgardeo (`https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<org>/oauth2/token`, measured 2026-08-06)

| Question | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed-port loopback (`127.0.0.1:<port>`) registrable | Registrable — all four callback ports were registered literally and a login bound and returned to `127.0.0.1:10425`. |
| Any-port loopback (RFC 8252 §7.3) | **Supported** — a login through `127.0.0.1:16000`, a port the application never registered, completed. |
| Redirect URI validation rules | Exact match by default; a `regexp=(url1\|url2)` prefix ORs several exact URLs. Not otherwise measured — a true single-URL wildcard syntax is a documentation question an experiment cannot disprove. |
| Refresh-grant scope narrowing | **Honored** — a session for `example:status:read example:status:write`, refreshed for `example:status:read` alone, received exactly that (no protocol scopes retained either). |
| Access token `aud` | The **client ID**, never the API resource identifier, and not configurable — the Protocol tab's Audience field applies to the ID token only. |

### Identity Server 7.3.0 (`https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token`, measured 2026-08-06)

| Question | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Any-port loopback (RFC 8252 §7.3) | **Supported** — even though the application's callbacks were registered as `regexp=(...)` enumerating all four ports explicitly, the port was still waived: loopback flexibility applies ahead of the registered pattern, not as a fallback. |
| Refresh-grant scope narrowing | **Honored** — same pattern as Asgardeo, protocol scopes dropped too. |
| Access token `aud` | The **API resource identifier**, once it is added to the application's audience list (an empty list falls back to the client ID alone, as on Asgardeo). |

### ThunderID 1.0.0-beta (`https://localhost:8490`, measured 2026-08-06)

Thunder decides the audience per request, by an RFC 8707 resource indicator,
rather than from the application's registration — a question the other two
products never raise.

| Question | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Refresh-grant scope narrowing | **Honoured** — same pattern as the other two products. |
| Access token `aud` | The resource server's identifier, exactly and alone — no client ID beside it. |
| Resource indicator on the authorization request | **Required**, refused with `invalid_target` ("No resource parameter supplied and no default resource server is configured") otherwise — unless a resource server is set as the tenant's **default**, in which case it is used when none is supplied. |
| Resource indicator on the refresh grant | Not required — inherited from the authorization that established the session. |
| Resource indicator on client credentials | Required, same default-resource exception as authorization. |
| Multiple resource indicators | Rejected — "Only a single resource parameter is supported." |
| Resource server identifier format | Must be an absolute URI; a bare name like `example-status` is refused. |
| Unauthorised scopes on client credentials | Silently dropped — the grant still succeeds with a narrower token, so the shell then refuses because it cannot prove the token carries what was asked for. |
| Device authorization grant | Absent — no `device_authorization_endpoint` in discovery. |

Any-port loopback was not measured against Thunder: the walkthrough registers
all four callback ports explicitly there too, so nothing in the shell depends
on the answer.

### What each verdict means for the shell

- **Any-port `supported`:** the deployment is at RFC 8252 §7.3 / Identity
  Server 6.0.0+ parity. The four-port callback registration is not strictly
  required there but stays, since older Identity Server deployments remain in
  scope.
- **Any-port `rejected`:** exact-match only — the four registered ports are
  load-bearing, and the shell's refusal to fall back to an unregistered port
  is what keeps the failure legible.
- **Narrowing `honored`:** the broker's scoped refresh works as designed and a
  module receives exactly what it asked for.
- **Narrowing `ignored` or `rejected`:** brokered acquisition refuses with
  `auth.narrowing_unavailable`. Login and session persistence are unaffected —
  that refusal is the designed outcome, not a fallback to relax.

## What these runs leave behind

Nothing that persists.

- The context document is written into a temporary state root that the test
  removes. Your own `~/.wso2` is never read or written.
- The session is stored under the secure-store reference `wso2-cli-smoke`, which
  no human would choose for a real context, and is deleted before and after
  every run. A real session under any other reference is never touched.
- The access tokens the runs obtain are never written anywhere and never
  printed. Runs report token lengths and expiry times only.

On macOS the first secure-store write may raise a keychain prompt. Allowing it
once is enough.
